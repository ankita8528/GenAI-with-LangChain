Various types of prompts has already been discussed in another repo. [Refer to this link](https://github.com/ankita8528/Modern-Generative-AI---2025/blob/main/model_interaction/1.%20prompt_engineering.md)

Other than what we have already discussed about prompts, what, why and how, we need to also understand some important things here as well. 

## System, Human, and AI Messages in LangChain

When using Chat Models in LangChain, the conversation is broken into messages, and each message has a role. Think of it like a chatroom with three participants:

### 1. System Message

Acts like the guidebook or instruction manual for the AI. It defines how the AI should behave throughout the conversation.

Example:

> “You are a polite teacher who explains science to children.”
>
> “You are a strict proof-checker who never gives personal opinions.”

***No matter what the user asks, the AI will try to stick to this role.***

###2. Human Message

This is simply the user’s input (your question or instruction). It represents what you are asking the AI to do. This is what we discussed in the other repo (types of prompts - the user input).

Example:

> “Explain black holes in simple words.”
>
> “Translate this sentence into French.”

***It’s the main driver of the conversation.***

### 3. AI Message 

This is the AI’s response to the human message. It shows what the model says after reading the system + human messages.

Example:

> “A black hole is like a giant vacuum cleaner in space that even light cannot escape.”

***It’s the output you actually see.***

## How They Work Together

> System: sets the rules.
>
> Human: asks the question.
>
> AI: gives the answer.

Like a play:

System = Director → tells the actor how to behave.

Human = Audience → asks questions.

AI = Actor → replies according to the director’s rules.

---

In short:

*System Message → Defines the AI’s role/behavior.*

*Human Message → User’s query or instruction.*

*AI Message → AI’s reply/output.*
